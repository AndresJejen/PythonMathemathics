# PythonMathemathics

Hi Again, here i will be going to publish some python scripts or notebooks where i try to explain some mathematics analysis.

1. **Sin_z_Polar** - How mapping circles into w plane (polar form).
2. **Sin_z_cartesian** - How mapping a infinite region into w plane (cartesian form).
